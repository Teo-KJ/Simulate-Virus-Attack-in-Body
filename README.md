## About the Project
This project is on creating an agent-based simulation project to simulate the effects of COVID-19 infection on a human body, with regards to oxygen supply and organ functionality. In this simulation, the body gets affected internally when one is infected with COVID-19, as the infection can limit the circulation of oxygen supply througout the body. Organs need oxygen supply in order to function properly, hence with an infection, the organs can be severely impacted.

The objective of implementing this simulation is to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on one's internal organs with varying factors such as the initial organ functionalities, in the case of patients with pre-existing conditions on their organs, as well as the viral load within the body.

## Running the Simulation
This simulation can be executed through this [link](https://teo-kj.github.io/Simulate-Virus-Attack-in-Body/Project_Simulation_2.html).

## Technical Implementation
This simulation is implemented with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Other Simulation
In addition to this simulation, we have implemented 2 other system dynamics models on InsightMaker to study the replication of the virus in the body and how it spreads throughout the body, as well as how the body mounts an immune response to the virus. The following are the InsightMaker links.
1. [Model for first time infected individual](https://insightmaker.com/insight/245319/System-Dynamic-Model-1a-First-time-Infected-Individual)
2. [Model for previously infected individual](https://insightmaker.com/insight/245253/System-Dynamic-Model-1b-Previously-infected-individual)

## Guide
Q: How to separate the JavaScript files for modularity?

A: You may separate the files into respective JS files by following the guide from this [StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3244361/can-i-access-variables-from-another-file).
